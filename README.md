# project Angular-app


# Description

An Angular project is a web application or website developed using Angular, a popular open-source front-end web framework maintained by Google.


# Getting Started

To install Angular on Ubuntu, you'll need to install Node.js and the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). Here's a step-by-step guide

## Install Node.js and npm

```bash

sudo apt update
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```

## Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your system.

```bash

sudo apt update
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
```

## Prerequisites

```bash

node -v (v18.20)
npm -v  (10.7)
```

## Install the Angular CLI

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can install the Angular CLI globally

```bash

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Verify the installation

```bash

ng version
```


#### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**


```bash

https://github.com/rsingh0706/Angular-app.git

2. Navigate into the project directory

```bash

cd angular-app
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash

npm install 
```

4. Serve the application

```bash

```


By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:4200
